### Decorators

* Decorators are evolved from the concept of closures.
* A decorator function is a higher order function that takes a function as an argument and returns the inner function.
* A decorator is capable of adding extra functionality to an existing function, without altering it.
* The decorator function is prefixed with @ symbol and written above the function definition.

```python

@outer

def greet():

   pass

```
